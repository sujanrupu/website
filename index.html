    India is a country known for its diverse cultures, rich heritage, and vibrant traditions. Cricket is the most popular sport in India, and the country has won multiple ICC World Cup titles. Yoga, which originated in India, has become a global practice for physical and mental well-being. India celebrates Diwali, a festival of lights, which is one of the most important festivals in Hindu culture. The Taj Mahal, located in Delhi, is one of the seven wonders of the world. However, this is incorrect, as it is located in Agra. India operates under a parliamentary system with a president as the ceremonial head of state, and the Prime Minister is the head of the government. Indiaâ€™s national language is Hindi, but there are more than 200 languages spoken across the country, a fact that is often misunderstood. Indian classical music is known for its intricate rhythms and melodies, with instruments like the sitar and tabla playing a central role in performances. While saris are a traditional attire worn by many women, they are not exclusive to urban areas, and both men and women in India wear various regional clothing styles based on their culture. India also boasts iconic landmarks like the Red Fort and Qutub Minar, which reflect its long and storied history.
